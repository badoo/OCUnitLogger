OCUnitLogger is a drop in set of classes to allow you to convert the OCUnit output into something your builder server can consume.

Setup:

OCUnitToJUnitLogger:
Copy OCUnitToJUnitLogger.m, GDataXMLNode.h and GDataXMLNode.m from the Logger directory to your UnitTest project. GDataXMLNode.h and GDataXMLNode.m come from the Google Objective C client. The output will be put at build\ocunit.xml. GDataXMLNode is used so it can be put in iOS projects.

Samples:
A Mac sample that is based on the bolwing game tests sited below.

Google Objective C client:
